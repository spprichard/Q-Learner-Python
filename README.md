## Assumptions
- You have a rabbitMQ running on port 5672
  - This could include having it running in a docker container, exposing port 5672
  - In the Rabbit directory there is Dockerfile for creating a RabbitMQ Docker container. This should work... ü§î


- Pyhon 2.7
  - The requirement.txt is responsible for listing all things your env needs. These dependencies assume Python 2.7 üêç



*Note:*
  It may be nice to have a quick way to activate this env. Try adding an alias to your .bash_profile or equivalent
